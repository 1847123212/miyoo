# OpenDingux for Miyoo/Bittboy Handheld
![Alt text](imgs/main.jpg)
  
## Introduction
You might ask me why do you need to port Linux OS on Miyoo/Bittboy handheld because stock firmware seems pretty good so far ? Since stock firmware is Melis OS that is close-source for Allwinner SoC, the performance is not good as I expected (not you) and it is not easy to port game and emulator to this OS because we cannot get more information on this OS unless reverse it (it is not easy as you think). Of course, it also lacks toolchain to port apps and emulator. So, if I can port Linux OS into this device, I think it will be more powerful (exceed my expectation). Besides, we can also port more games and emulators into this device if it is Linux OS. Now, I finish most of tasks and it is time to share it to all of you, enjoy !  
  
If you would like to re-build all of sources, please refer to wiki page but you might need to get toolchain, kernel and uboot in release page firstly.
