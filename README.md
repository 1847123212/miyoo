## Introduction
You might ask why do you need to port Linux OS into Miyoo/Bittboy handheld because stock firmware seems running pretty well ? Since stock firmware is Melis OS that is close-source for Allwinner SoC, the performance is not good as I expected (not you) and it is not easy to port game and emulator to this OS because we cannot get more information from google unless reversing (it is not easy as you think). Of course, it also lacks toolchain to port app and emulator. So, if I can port Linux OS into this tiny device, I think it will be more powerful. Besides, we can also port more games and emulators into this device if it is Linux OS. Now, I finish most of tasks and it is time to share to all of you, enjoy !  
  
If you would like to re-build all of sources, please refer to wiki page but you might need to get toolchain, kernel and uboot in release page firstly.
